open run.pyw to start the program

This is a program to encrypt files (made for a university small project)
all of background images and button images are encoded in base64 (for dependency) 
in case it's wanted to combine all in one EXE file like I did later. (using pyinstaller)
you can change the images through
the file : bg_images.py
